## Project Approach
Originally, I had planned to make a restaurant finder app for low-carb options in a users area. Like Yelp, but specifically keto. Kelp, if you will. Over the course of the weeks though, I realized I wanted to build more of a community instead of just an app to find things. This led me to the idea of a keto social site where users could not only post recipes and comment on others.

I began by planning out my table relations and mapping users to their posted recipes and comments. I then began building a monolithic backend for my data.
